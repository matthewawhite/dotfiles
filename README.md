# Dotfiles
This repository includes my personal dotfiles which includes .bashrc, .inputrc, .bash\_profile, and .aliases files. These dot files have been developed on MacOS but should work on Linux as well. However, the customization script uses a MacOS package manager and would need to be modified for other OS's.

## Setup
Clone this repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/matthewawhite/dotfiles.git</code><br>

Open up the directory in Terminal and run:<br>
<code>./customize</code><br>
This will put all of the dotfiles in the correct location in the file system, download tools such as Node.js and git, download apps such as Chrome and Spotify, and also modify the OS settings.<br>

**Warning** before using the customization script, make sure you are okay with the customizations I have added.
